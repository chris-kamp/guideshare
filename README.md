# About

GuideShare is a project created for coursework in the Ruby on Rails component of the Coder Academy bootcamp. It is a prototype for a two-sided marketplace which allows users to publish, buy and sell guides for common tasks. 

# Features and technologies

The focus for this project was on the back-end logic, which implements a full CRUD application as well as:

- file upload using the Cloudinary CDN;
- payment processing with Stripe;
- user registration and authentication with Devise;
- authorisation using Pundit; and
- search and tag-based filtering implemented using ActiveRecord queries.

Front-end views are styled with Bootstrap.
